Jumpcon!

The main objective of this web application is to allow fans of Shonen Jump magasin to attend the annual JumpCon conference. Therefore, the event handlers approached me in order to develop a website in view of the upcoming JumpCon 2016 conference. Feel free to review the code and give further recommendations on how it may be improved.
